# Rules & Guidelines

## Rules

### Be Civil
> The Society encourages open and candid discussions and debates.  However, all communications should be respectful. Differences of opinion are okay; personal attacks are not. Messages or content that are violent, threatening, abusive, sexually explicit, obscene, offensive, hateful, derogatory, defamatory, or are racially, ethnically, or otherwise objectionable content will be removed.

### Stay on topic
> Messages should be relevant to the topic(s) being discussed. Keep in mind that this is not a place for unsolicited personal or commercial solicitation or advertising (e.g., “Free Stock”, etc.).

### Don’t upload or post inappropriate content
> If a user uploads inappropriate, pornographic or offensive, or otherwise objectionable content to the Sites, such user may be banned from the Community. These types of posts will be removed immediately.

### No spam
> Do not bombard your local community members with messages that aren't adding to the conversation.

### Keep it legal
> Participating in, suggesting, or encouraging any illegal activity is cause for immediate ban from the Community.

### Observe copyright and trademark law
> The posting of copyrighted videos, photos, articles or other material beyond what is protected as fair use is prohibited, and moderators may remove such posts. Do not pass off someone else’s trademark as your own.

### Respect privacy
> Do not post personal or any other information that you do not want made public and respect the privacy of other members. If you would like to post information or content from/about another user, request permissions first.

### Let us know of any issues
> Our Community team does monitor posts, but we may miss something. We encourage members to report content which they feel violates any of the above Community Rules so we can review and take the appropriate action.

### It’s your content
> The views and opinions expressed by individual members do not necessarily reflect the views and opinions of oneleif or its partners. Please remember that any comments or content you share on our platforms are your sole responsibility.

### Ramifications
> If someone is a repeat offender, we are forced to take action to keep the integrity of the community. Repeat offenders may have limited communication, or have a ban placed on their account.
