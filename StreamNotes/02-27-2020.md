### Bread for the Journey
We will be doing some work for a local non-profit. Scope is TBA after a meeting with the client.

### Fun Topics

> maybe expanding on the mentorship idea and brainstorming how that's gonna work?

> I want personal stories of how you guys got to where you are today, like what made you dev, what did you try and fail and what was the moment that got you to where you are
- medium article text interviews instead?

### UPDATE THE RULES

## Active Project ideas
